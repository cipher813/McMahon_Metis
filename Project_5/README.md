**To run:**
In terminal type:
`python train1_2.py` to train by inputting midi files and outputting a generated midi; or
`python create1_2.py` to create midi from preexisting weights and notes and outputting generated midi

Support files include:
weight_generator.py for functions pertaining to weight creation; and
midi_generator.py for functions pertaining to midi creation
