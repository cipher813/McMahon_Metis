       "      <th>\"\\n\\n Your revert - IRC nick parameters \\n\\nHi, thanks for your comments when reverting me here, but I'm not sure if you understand the confusion experienced as a helper on that IRC channel. While I do see you in -helpers from time to time, these days I rarely see you in -help itself, so it's hard to grasp where your reasoning stems from. I do welcome your explanations.\\n\\nI'm confused about the supposed benefit of using WPhelp### over Guest###. In any given day, I see tens, if not over a hundred, instances of the WPhelp nick. The conversation often ends up something like this: WPhelp98392 asks, \"\"Can you help me with my draft?\"\" The helper says, \"\"WPhelp89643: Do you understand conflict of interest?\"\" Then WPhelp98392 says, \"\"Sorry what?\"\" And the the helper must explain with !public. Sometimes the helpee will say \"\"I really have to look at the numbers to see who is who.\"\" On the contrary, I see few Guest### nicks, and while they are confusing, they are definitely not as widespread as the instances of WPhelp. These users came from the template  which does not supply a nick parameter.\\n\\nIt takes a long time to manually squint to look for each WPhelp's number if not using autocomplete, and when using autocomplete, you really do run the risk of autocompleting the wrong nick. If you remove the nick parameter, just like the way it is in current freenode webchat, then helpees would ideally choose their own username as the nickname field, eliminating the amount of asking, \"\"What is your username?\"\" In short, it would be easier to deal with Guest### nicknames (the few that we'd have) than the piles of confusing WPhelp usernames when everyone literally has almost the same nickname and nobody knows what's going on, with the added benefit of perhaps helpees supplying their usernames. IRC is already a confusing environment for newbies - better to make it less confusing if possible. —  oh hello! \"</th>\n",

       "      <th>\"\\n\\n Your revert - IRC nick parameters \\n\\nHi, thanks for your comments when reverting me here, but I'm not sure if you understand the confusion experienced as a helper on that IRC channel. While I do see you in -helpers from time to time, these days I rarely see you in -help itself, so it's hard to grasp where your reasoning stems from. I do welcome your explanations.\\n\\nI'm confused about the supposed benefit of using WPhelp### over Guest###. In any given day, I see tens, if not over a hundred, instances of the WPhelp nick. The conversation often ends up something like this: WPhelp98392 asks, \"\"Can you help me with my draft?\"\" The helper says, \"\"WPhelp89643: Do you understand conflict of interest?\"\" Then WPhelp98392 says, \"\"Sorry what?\"\" And the the helper must explain with !public. Sometimes the helpee will say \"\"I really have to look at the numbers to see who is who.\"\" On the contrary, I see few Guest### nicks, and while they are confusing, they are definitely not as widespread as the instances of WPhelp. These users came from the template  which does not supply a nick parameter.\\n\\nIt takes a long time to manually squint to look for each WPhelp's number if not using autocomplete, and when using autocomplete, you really do run the risk of autocompleting the wrong nick. If you remove the nick parameter, just like the way it is in current freenode webchat, then helpees would ideally choose their own username as the nickname field, eliminating the amount of asking, \"\"What is your username?\"\" In short, it would be easier to deal with Guest### nicknames (the few that we'd have) than the piles of confusing WPhelp usernames when everyone literally has almost the same nickname and nobody knows what's going on, with the added benefit of perhaps helpees supplying their usernames. IRC is already a confusing environment for newbies - better to make it less confusing if possible. —  oh hello! \"</th>\n",

He was, by most accounts, not the best father figure, but that doesn't diminish the effect he had on Cher's childhood, and more importantly his role as her connection to Armenia. To this day, Cher speaks Armenian because of him, and her philanthropy to Armenia wouldn't exist if he was not her father. Information on Sarkisian is hard to come by on the web, and the Wikipedia page in question was one of the few resources available. If you could restore the page, I'd really appreciate it.\\n\\nThanks so much,\\nRafi Guroian\\n\\n152.130.11.197</th>\n",

I'm quoting the portion of the report that notes the facts on the ground that support the Armenian argument. In any case, if you wish to censor the Armenian side here, then perhaps you should refer this to arbitration. Also, note that HRW used to be called Helsinki Watch. My point was that this is a separate document then the one generally referred to as that of HRW.  \"</th>\n",

While I do see you in -helpers from time to time, these days I rarely see you in -help itself, so it\\'s hard to grasp where your reasoning stems from. I do welcome your explanations.\\n\\nI\\'m confused about the supposed benefit of using WPhelp### over Guest###. In any given day, I see tens, if not over a hundred, instances of the WPhelp nick. The conversation often ends up something like this: WPhelp98392 asks, \"\"Can you help me with my draft?\"\" The helper says, \"\"WPhelp89643: Do you understand conflict of interest?\"\" Then WPhelp98392 says, \"\"Sorry what?\"\" And the the helper must explain with !public. Sometimes the helpee will say \"\"I really have to look at the numbers to see who is who.\"\" On the contrary, I see few Guest### nicks, and while they are confusing, they are definitely not as widespread as the instances of WPhelp. These users came from the template  which does not supply a nick parameter.\\n\\nIt takes a long time to manually squint to look for each WPhelp\\'s number if not using autocomplete, and when using autocomplete, you really do run the risk of autocompleting the wrong nick. If you remove the nick parameter, just like the way it is in current freenode webchat, then helpees would ideally choose their own username as the nickname field, eliminating the amount of asking, \"\"What is your username?\"\" In short, it would be easier to deal with Guest### nicknames (the few that we\\'d have) than the piles of confusing WPhelp usernames when everyone literally has almost the same nickname and nobody knows what\\'s going on, with the added benefit of perhaps helpees supplying their usernames. IRC is already a confusing environment for newbies - better to make it less confusing if possible. —\\xa0\\xa0oh\\xa0hello! \"',\n",

Now the passage seems to say again that metaphysical libertarians require a belief in a soul. This is a falsehood of such magnitude which cannot pass. To require a belief in a soul and implicitly require belief in God is anti-democratic, anti-freedom, anti-emotion, anti-religion. Very clearly in metaphysical libertarianism the way to arrive at a conclusion about an agent is by free belief. I have quoted 2 metaphysical libertarian philosophers previously going out of their way saying that they are opposed to evidence, even against philosophical evidence in coming to a conclusion about the agent. But really ALL late medieval monks are generally considered to be metaphysical libertarians. It is also quite obvious that religion centers around FAITH, not around evidence gathering. So I think I have made a fair and correct representation of common metaphysical libertarianism.\\n\\nBut on the other side I do feel I need more support from people here on wiki that what I wrote is a correct and fair representation of common metaphysical libertarian position. Think this through, is the way in which metaphysical libertarianists reach a conclusion about an agent a free way, or a way forced by evidence?

Wikipedia has writers and administrators who squash the truth.   They are anti libertarian and they glorify totalitarianism with their Nazi-style behavior.  Wikipedia’s lies are so infamous that it has inspired a nationwide boycott, especially for the apparent Neo-Nazism of some of its more rabid writers.  \\n\\nWikipedia writers prevent any mention of the new historical discovery that the USA was the source of the Nazi salute. The USA\\'s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers\\' Party (Nazis), as shown by Dr. Rex Curry.  It was not an ancient Roman salute. Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the \"\"ancient Roman salute\"\" is a myth. A image search on the web for the “original pledge of allegiance” provides additional information.\\n\\nThe Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. Additional information is available in web searches for the text \"\"military salute became the Nazi salute.\"\"\\n\\nFrancis Bellamy (author of the \"\"Pledge of Allegiance\"\") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel \"\"Looking Backward\"\") and Charles Bellamy (author of \"\"A Moment of Madness\"\") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the \"\"Nationalism\"\" movement in the USA, the \"\"Nationalist\"\" magazine, the \"\"Nationalist Educational Association,\"\" and their dogma of \"\"military socialism,\"\" and Edward inspired the \"\"Nationalist Party\"\" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute. \"\"Nazi\"\" means \"\"National Socialist German Workers\\' Party.\"\" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist\"\" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. \"\"  Additional information is available in image or text searches for “swastika secrets.” \\n\\nDr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas are based on the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a \"\"swastika.\"\"  German National Socialists did not use the word \"\"swastika,\"\" but called their symbol a \"\"Hakenkreuz.\"\"  \\n\\nRecently, one Wikipedia writer became wiser and improved the \"\"Roman salute\"\" article somewhat so that it recognizes and repeats some of Rex Curry\\'s discoveries. Other pledge and salute articles on Wikipedia are as bad as ever.\\n\\nThe Wikipedia article for the \"\"Roman salute\"\" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by phonies who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: \"\"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America.\"\" Wikipedia liars also used the painting \"\"The Oath of the Horatii\"\" as absurd support for a Roman connection. The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute.  Yet, Wikipedia regulars allowed the disinformation, including the dates “1787?-1934?” with the question marks included, to remain posted on Wikipedia, while deleting anyone who tried to correct the propaganda.\\n\\nSimilar criticisms apply to the Wikipedia pages on Francis Bellamy, Edward Bellamy and the Pledge of Allegiance.\\n\\nWikipedia falsifiers use the misnomer \"\"public schools\"\" when they mean \"\"government schools\"\" and they both cover-up the Bellamys\\' desire to promote a government takeover of education, a desire to end all of the better alternatives, and to impose socialism (and what the Bellamys called \"\"military socialism\"\") within government schools. The Bellamys loved the military and wanted all of society to ape the military. Those points also help explain why Francis Bellamy enjoyed starting the pledge with a military salute.\\n\\nSome regular writers on Wikipedia knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of',\n",

Even when there is vast consensus against him, since he is paid to be here, he knows every possible way to limit such exposure and simply logs complaints against the opposition until they are completely outlawed and banned. Typically this type of behavior is traditional in communist totalitarian dictatorships. My comment was of course a legitimate content comment as all content is monitored and approved by DIREKTOR and his lobby group here on wikipedia. Unless you have something negative to add - don't add it at all because he will have it removed. This is because this topic in itself is still political in modern day Croatia where any type of objective historical discussion is branded as communist revisionism as outlined by one Dr. Ante Birin at the Croatian Historic Institute who recently held a great discussion on the matter. I would like to point out that the user DIREKTOR has directly linked me to 'nazism' - even though anyone with half a brain knows that German National Socialism is not the same as Croatian Ustasism - but of course, that is not an attack on my personal character. I have not been blocked for any relevant reason other than the fact that I oppose DIREKTORs nonacademic claim to all WW2 Croatia-related articles. Some of my statements were in hope that someone would notice his bias which is the biggest elephant I have ever seen standing in a room ever. Regarding Dr. Pavelic's nationality - Pavelic did not believe in Yugoslavism, he was a self-declared anti-yugoslav and on many occasions publicly -and in written form - argued the idiotic basis of such a movement. But of course it only makes sense to have Pavelic be a Yugoslav so that tito can be considered a Croat in DIREKTORs logical political platform here on wikipedia. Thank you.\",\n",
